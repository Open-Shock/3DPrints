# Shocklink D1Mini Box

> [!WARNING]  
> Measurements are off, this currently does not fit, please wait until it has been fixed before printing this


Made a new box from scratch based on `.ek.`'s box from the discord which should be easier to print.
Notable changes includes
-no support material required
-almost no overhangs greater than 45 degrees
-actual source cad file and step file 
-Current shocklink logo
-Chamfers on bottom instead of fillets to reduce print issues

## Suggested Print Settings
Filament Type: PLA but pretty much anything should work
Nozzle: 0.4mm
Layer Height: 0.2mm but 0.3 should work has not been tested though.

### Bottom case
Build Plate Adhesion: Brim if issues arrise.

### Top lid
Build Plate Adhesion: Brim recomended since the first layer has some small detail on the sides but it does print fine with decent bed-adhesion.
The second suggested orientation is if you want your beds texture on the top surface may be very tricky to print due to small features.
