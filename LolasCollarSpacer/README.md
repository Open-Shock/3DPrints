# OpenShock Collar Spacer For AliExpress (CaiXianlin) Shock Collar 
Nifty spacer for the shock collar. It has holes in the bottom to charge and hit the power button on the bottom.

Oh yeah this file also includes the shock collar as a 3D model. I modeled it myself and wont say its 100% accurate to the irl one but for this its close enough.

Also included is a sides-slimmed version by nullstalgia, in the "NullSlim" files.
## Suggested Print Settings
Filament Type: PLA but pretty much anything should work
Nozzle: 0.4mm
Layer Height: 0.2mm but 0.3 should work has not been tested though.
